# TODO List

- [ ] Validate sub agent flow is proper, maybe sub agents need more context. 
- [ ] Docs website
- [ ] More involved agent examples
- [ ] Per agent configs (ability to use claude for example for HTML Coding agents while using o3 for reasoning or deepseek for cheaper general agents) 
- [ ] Find bugs
- [ ] UUID _everything_
- [ ] Debugging
- [ ] Improved llms helper
- [X] Refactor / implement a tracing system
- [X] Add completions API support (enables nearly any model/api router support)
